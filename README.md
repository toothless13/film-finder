# film-finder

This is a Codecademy project, where they provided the general structure, styling and setup of the page, and then I went through and added the API functionality.

I also added the following features:
- Added more information about the film
* This included the release date, which I manipulated into a more readable form
* I also displayed the first 3 cast members, storing them in an array, and adding them to the page in a readable format
- I included the functionality to see which films the user liked and disliked, which would only become visible when one of the like or dislike buttons had been clicked. When a new round was started, this would reset and become hidden again

I also learned about Semantic Git whilst completing this project, so starting using that in my commits as well.
